## 2021

JavaScript solutions are run with node `v16.7.0` via tye integrated terminal of Visual Studio Code.
For contests I did in real-time, I may have edited them slightly afterward, but no major revisions.

Notes on contests I did:

Also took some time to figure out the nested structure, but it made sense from that. Maybe using nearley or something would have been faster. |
