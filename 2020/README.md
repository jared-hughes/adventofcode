## 2020

JavaScript solutions are run with node `v10.19.0` via Script package in Atom.

For contests I did in real-time, I may have edited them slightly afterward, but no major revisions.

Notes on contests I did:

| Contest Number | End Time 1 | Rank 1 | End Time 2 | Rank 2 | Notes | Learned
| --- | --: | :-- | --: | :-- | ----- | ---
| 1 | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | . | `arr.splice(-1,1)` works as `pop()`; (Oh wait there is an `arr.pop()`). JavaScript defaults to alphabetical sorting. Use `numbers.sort((a, b) => a - b)` to sort numerically. Can use bitwise xor as boolean xor when given booleans.
| 2 | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | . | .
| 3 | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | . | Reduce with `[start_value, ...array].reduce((accumulator, item) => nextItem)`
| 4 | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | . | In regex, capture named groups with `(?<name>regex)` then use `match.groups`. `Object.fromEntries` reconstructs an object from list of `[key, value]` pairs. Use `array.includes(element)`. `array.every(f)` and `array.some(f)` work like Python's `all` and `any` but require functions to map.
| 5 | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | . | Use a set with `s=new Set()`, `s.has(elem)`, `s.add(elem)`, and `s.size()`
| 6 | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | . | Use `string.slice(start, end)` (inclusive) instead of `array.splice(index, numDelete, newEntries)` when you have a string
| 7  | 09:22 | 143 | 15:36 | 164 | (Started&nbsp;2&nbsp;mins&nbsp;late)&nbsp;Felt&nbsp;good&nbsp;about&nbsp;this one! | Use an object instead of a `Map`, and `Object.keys(map[bag]).length === 0` checks if empty object
| 8  | 06:13 | 817 | 15:17 | 925 | Part 1 was decent-ish, but Part 2 was slow. Hit too many bugs because not cloning properly. Could have used different algorithm possibly | Use `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))` for quick deep clone when necessary.
| 9  | 03:48 | 187 | 09:19 | 337 | Probably could have been faster by not reading as much of the backstory ;). Also got stuck on Part 2 for a few minutes because thought it said *first* and *last*. Maybe should try one-filing | Use `arr.slice(start, end)` for analog of Python's arr[start:end]
| 10  | 03:08 | 42 | 05:50 | 23 | YES! Lodash helped me go faster, as did skipping the backstory. I didn't have time to test with the smaller cases on part 2, but I didn't need to. I think that's OK in general because bugfixes would take more than a minute anyway. I really had to recognize the DP approach instantly.|
| 11 | 22:30 | 1399 | 24:49 | 538 | I was big dumb and got stuck accessing `arr[x][y]` instead of `arr[y][x]` for way too long. (The sample input was symmetric so I didn't catch it then). Also switched from a flat (been golfing too much) to nested array representation and forgot to update `_.clone` to `_.cloneDeep`, wasting time. Also had  | Start with 2D array representation from the beginning (using a single `.map` would save code size but not time), and use cloneDeep from the beginning. With reference to the `[x][y]` issue, I could consider transposing (`_.zip`) the matrix and do `[x][y]` intentionally from here on. Or just practice `[y][x]`. Maybe I should make a reference document of sample code for everything I know; I could have saved *tons* of time if I had a previous implementation of Game of Life saved somewhere (Googling for one feels like cheating).
| 12 | 08:56 | 599 | 10:31 | 84 | Completed part 2 very quickly because I hardly had to change anything from my implementation in part 1. Difficulties with part 1: got hung up with sequential assignment (was doing `dx=-dy; dy=dx` instead of using a temp variable), and had `270-v` instead of `360-v` in the the first map. Second was silly mistake, but first one could be resolved by using a matrix library, which would have also saved time elsewhere. Another major time spend was the switch cases. I think `if`s would be faster, and a matrix/vector library would make it much faster indeed. | Can use `[a,b]=[b,a]` to swap variables `a` and `b`. Try out `node-lapack`, `tensorflow.js`'s matrices, `numjs`, or `math.js`. One of these would be a good library.
| 13 | 04:42 | 147 | 18:15 | 135 | Bit slow on part 1 because I somehow struggled with `arr.indexOf()`. I think that's just practice, or use iterative approach instead. Part 2 was the big time loss though. Immediately recognized CRT but struggled with implementation because I forgot  | `_.indexOf` and `_.minBy` exist. No need to math out an analytic solution when you can have the code bash it out. Use expressions such as `math.mod(a,b)` instead of `a%b` when you're dealing with mathematical modular arithmetic.
| 14 | 26:23 | 2379 | 36:45 | 969 | I was not on my A game here ... mouse wasn't working so I had to reboot computer at the beginning. Main costs were me being dumb though. Struggled with the parsing during part 1 for no good reason. Also had some overflow issues when dealing with bitshifts. Also got hung up a little on Part 2 treating a mask of 0 applied to 1 resulting in 1 (strange behavior). | Use `arr1.concat(arr2)` to concatenate two arrays. Does not modify in place. Use `_.values(obj)` to get values of object `obj`. JavaScript's 64 bit float numbers (53 bit mantissa) are converted to 32 bit integers for bitwise operations, unfortunate. If dealing with larger integers, avoid by using string/array operations or avoiding bitwise operations such as by `math.pow`, repeated multiplication, etc.
