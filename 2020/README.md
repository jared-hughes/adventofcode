## 2020

JavaScript solutions are run with node `v10.19.0` via Script package in Atom.

For contests I did in real-time, I may have edited them slightly afterward, but no major revisions.

Notes on contests I did in real-time:

| Contest Number | Start time (minutes, approx)| End Time 1 | Rank 1 | End Time 2 | Rank 2
| --- | --- | --: | :-- | --: | :--
| 7 | 02:00 | 09:22 | 143 | 15:36 | 164
