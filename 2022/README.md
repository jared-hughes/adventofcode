## 2022

TypeScript solutions are run with node v18.7.0 via the integrated terminal of Visual Studio Code using `./run day01.ts` etc.
For contests I did in real-time, I may have edited them slightly afterward, but no major revisions.

Notes on contests I did:

| Contest Number | End Time 1 | Rank 1 | End Time 2 | Rank 2 | Notes                                                                                                            | Learned                                                                                                                                      |

| 1              |      03:44 | 1699   |      04:13 | 880    | Chrome died. Idk why; had to restart, costing 2.5 minutes.                                                       | Be logged-in on Firefox as a backup I guess.                                                                                                 |
| 2              |      05:58 | 744    |      07:45 | 289    | Trolled a little                                                                                                 | Use `.find(...)` instead of `filter(...)[0]`. If you know the length of a string, get last character with `s[4]` instead of `[...s].at(-1)!` |
| 3              |      03:26 | 157    |      07:03 | 275    |                                                                                                                  | More helper functions :). Also, transform the input to numbers immediately if there's a clear mapping.                                       |
| 4              |      03:41 | 629    |      04:10 | 229    | Mixed up comparison on part 1 :(                                                                                 | Implement `range(lo, hi)` and parsing input helpers.                                                                                         |
| 5              |      04:08 | 16     |      04:23 | 8      | Vibin! The fire alarm was also vibin, but it worked out somehow.                                                 | Thankful I implemented `ints` immediately before, saved time parsing.                                                                        |
| 6              |      02:23 | 236    |      02:39 | 144    | Off-by-1 on part 1 leading to one minute loss. Thankful for `overlappingSlices` though                           | Check solution on the example input.                                                                                                         |
| 7              |      11:00 | 109    |      12:46 | 47     | Great one                                                                                                        | Want `prefixes` and `suffixes` functions (check the rest of APL/J/Jelly builtins)                                                            |
| 8              |       3:32 | 28     |       8:43 | 50     | Nice! On a roll <3                                                                                               | Might want some sort of grid helpers, like slices from point to point.                                                                       |
| 9              |       9:51 | 273    |      32:00 | 1493   | Agh, overwhelmed a little, and part 1 approach didn't transfer to part 2.                                        | If you see a forest of if-else, rethink the approach.                                                                                        |
| 10             |      14:02 | 2148   |      19:15 | 681    | Seriously overthought part 1. Thought the ops were ran in parallel                                               | Take a nap later in the day if you ever have to wake up early >:(                                                                            |
| 11             |      11:07 | 45     |      16:38 | 70     | Don't reach instantly to bigints lol (too slow). Just use mod                                                    |
| 12             |      10:39 | 263    |      15:07 | 342    | Misread part 2 as max instead of min lol                                                                         | Implement grid helpers bro. Also a queue and other stuff. Really convincing me to switch to Python                                           |
| 13             |      11:22 | 224    |      14:04 | 126    | Goofed up for a while on part 1 by using `or` instead of `&&`. This would not be a problem with pattern matching |
| 14             |       8:33 | 39     |      12:30 | 59     | Wasted time on part 2 by overthinking (subtracting area from triangle lol), but worked out yay                   | Get started on those grid helpers, including display. One useful tool: line between two points.                                              |
| 15             |       8:55 | 45     |      29:02 | 125    | Alright. Should have drawn a picture earlier on part 2 rather than keeping it in head                            |
| 16             |      30:53 | 185    |      48:50 | 50     | Ayy, fun difficult one                                                                                           |
| 17             |      15:26 | 17     |      36:55 | 67     | Yay, worked out well, except off-by-one `rocksAdded` on part 2                                                   |
| 18             |       4:09 | 291    |       9:15 | 31     | Messed up with two incorrect answers on part 1 (silly errors) and one on part 2. I'll take top 31 part 2 lol     | Implement custom sets and stuff, or switch to python/coconut smh.                                                                            |
| 19             |      42:34 | 68     |    1:18:30 | 331    | Still bad; solution hardly works, too many heuristics.                                                           |
| 20             |       9:59 | 25     |    1:00:59 | 1171   | Lmao that rank ratio. Assumed there were no duplicates on part 2 :(.                                             |
| 21             |       4:54 | 138    |      11:33 | 35     | Cheesed out part 2 with Mathematica `Solve`                                                                      |
| 22             |      11:10 | 13     |    1:48:12 | 459    | Part 2 was a doozy. Who decided to make the input shape different than the example >:(                           |
| 23             |      27:01 | 236    |      31:50 | 283    | Goofied part 1 with a typo :( plus under-annotated typescript plus javascript looseness                          |
