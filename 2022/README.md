## 2022

TypeScript solutions are run with node v18.7.0 via the integrated terminal of Visual Studio Code using `./run day01.ts` etc.
For contests I did in real-time, I may have edited them slightly afterward, but no major revisions.

Notes on contests I did:

| Contest Number | End Time 1 | Rank 1 | End Time 2 | Rank 2 | Notes                                                                                  | Learned                                                                                                                                      |

| 1              |      03:44 | 1699   |      04:13 | 880    | Chrome died. Idk why; had to restart, costing 2.5 minutes.                             | Be logged-in on Firefox as a backup I guess.                                                                                                 |
| 2              |      05:58 | 744    |      07:45 | 289    | Trolled a little                                                                       | Use `.find(...)` instead of `filter(...)[0]`. If you know the length of a string, get last character with `s[4]` instead of `[...s].at(-1)!` |
| 3              |      03:26 | 157    |      07:03 | 275    |                                                                                        | More helper functions :). Also, transform the input to numbers immediately if there's a clear mapping.                                       |
| 4              |      03:41 | 629    |      04:10 | 229    | Mixed up comparison on part 1 :(                                                       | Implement `range(lo, hi)` and parsing input helpers.                                                                                         |
| 5              |      04:08 | 16     |      04:23 | 8      | Vibin! The fire alarm was also vibin, but it worked out somehow.                       | Thankful I implemented `ints` immediately before, saved time parsing.                                                                        |
| 6              |      02:23 | 236    |      02:39 | 144    | Off-by-1 on part 1 leading to one minute loss. Thankful for `overlappingSlices` though | Check solution on the example input.                                                                                                         |
