## 2022

TypeScript solutions are run with node v18.7.0 via the integrated terminal of Visual Studio Code using `./run day01.ts` etc.
For contests I did in real-time, I may have edited them slightly afterward, but no major revisions.

Notes on contests I did:

| Contest Number | End Time 1 | Rank 1 | End Time 2 | Rank 2 | Notes                                                      | Learned                                      |
| -------------- | ---------: | :----- | ---------: | :----- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 1              |      03:44 | 1699   |      04:13 | 880    | Chrome died. Idk why; had to restart, costing 2.5 minutes. | Be logged-in on Firefox as a backup I guess. |
